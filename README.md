## Overview

Stellar Crowdfunding DApp is a production-style Web3 fundraising app built for the Stellar testnet. It combines a responsive frontend, Soroban smart contracts, reward-token inter-contract calls, live contract syncing, and CI/CD coverage into a single competition-ready project.

The emphasis is on clear architecture, visible proof, and a polished reviewer experience, with the contract, frontend, deployment workflow, and documentation treated as one system.

## What It Includes

- Wallet connection flow for Stellar testnet users
- Soroban contract donation call with live transaction submission
- Reward contract crediting through inter-contract communication
- Contract snapshot polling for goal, raised amount, and owner data
- Error handling and loading states throughout the donation flow
- Responsive desktop and mobile presentation
- Frontend and contract tests
- GitHub Actions CI pipeline
- Production deployment on Vercel

## Architecture

The project is split into two main parts:

- Frontend: `src/` contains the React + TypeScript interface, wallet flow, and contract-sync logic.
- Contracts: `contracts/crowdfunding/contracts/` contains the Soroban crowdfunding contract plus the reward-badge contract used during donations.

The frontend reads live testnet state, builds a donation transaction, signs it with the connected wallet, submits it to Soroban RPC, and then refreshes the contract snapshot so the UI stays aligned with chain state.

### On-Chain Flow

1. A user connects a supported Stellar wallet.
2. The frontend builds a Soroban donation transaction on testnet.
3. The wallet signs the transaction.
4. The app submits the signed transaction to RPC.
5. The crowdfunding contract records the donation, emits a donation event, and credits the reward contract.
6. The frontend refreshes the displayed goal, raised amount, and owner fields.

## Smart Contract Design

The main crowdfunding contract stores:

- `goal`
- `raised`
- `owner`
- donor contribution records
- funded status

It exposes helpers for:

- `initialize`
- `donate`
- `get_goal`
- `get_raised`
- `get_owner`
- `get_donor_contribution`
- `is_funded`

The `donate` function also performs an inter-contract call into the reward badge contract so donors receive a credit when they contribute.

The contract emits a `DonationReceived` event, which makes the donation history easier to surface in a real-world app and gives the frontend a clean signal to display in the activity feed.

## Frontend Experience

The interface is built around a two-panel dashboard:

- Left panel: campaign hero, wallet choice, live stats, and funding progress
- Right panel: wallet actions, donation input, contract address, explorer link, and debug trail

The frontend also:

- Detects available Stellar wallets
- Shows user-friendly wallet and transaction errors
- Tracks donation attempts with a debug trail
- Polls the contract on an interval so the dashboard stays fresh
- Keeps the layout usable on both desktop and mobile screens

## Testing And Quality

### Frontend Tests

The frontend includes Vitest coverage for helper utilities such as amount formatting and explorer URL generation.

### Contract Tests

The Soroban contract includes tests that verify:

- initialization
- donation progress updates
- multiple donations
- default getter values
- funded state behavior at goal completion

### CI/CD

GitHub Actions runs the main project checks on push and pull request events:

- frontend install
- frontend lint
- frontend build
- contract tests

### Notes For Judges

- The contract is deployed on Stellar testnet and can be explored using the public links above.
- The app is intentionally built around live chain reads and writes rather than static UI-only state.
- The README keeps proof screenshots and direct links up front so reviewers can verify the build quickly.
